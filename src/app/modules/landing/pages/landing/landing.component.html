            Yevgeniy (Jim) Brikman loves programming, writing, speaking, traveling, and lifting heavy things. He does
            not love talking about himself in the 3rd person. He is the co-founder of Gruntwork, a company that provides
            DevOps as a Service. He's also the author of two books published by O'Reilly Media: Hello, Startup and
            Terraform: Up & Running. Previously, he spent more than a decade building infrastructure and products that
            served hundreds of millions of users while working as a software engineer at LinkedIn, TripAdvisor, Cisco
            Systems, and Thomson Financial. For more info, check out his writing, speaking, projects, and photos.
